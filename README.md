# Nix node package repository

This is a collection of node packages expressed in the nix language. They can be installed via the nix package manager. They have been generated by [nixfromnpm](https://github.com/adnelson/nixfromnpm). The packages defined in this repo can be used as-is, for example as `buildInputs` or `propagatedBuildInputs` to other nix derivations, or can be used with `nixfromnpm` to auto-generate more nix expressions for other node packages. At present, the top 36 npm packages (as listed [here](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/star)) and all of their dependencies have been defined, though few of them tested.

## Using this library

Of course, make sure you have nix installed.

Clone the repo:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/adnelson/nix-node-packages.git
```

The expressions here refer to a `nixpkgs` path variable, so make sure you have it your `NIX_PATH`. For example, to point it at your `nixpkgs` channel:

```bash
$ export NIX_PATH="$HOME/.nix-defexpr/channels:$NIX_PATH"
```

After that you're free to do whatever you please with the library. Packages are located under the top-level attribute `nodePackages`. An unqualified name will build the latest version (as determined by comparing package version names), while a particular version can be referred to as shown below. For example, the following commands build the latest version of `grunt`, and version `0.4.5`, respectively:

```bash
$ nix-build nix-node-packages/nodePackages -A nodePackages.grunt
$ nix-build nix-node-packages/nodePackages -A nodePackages.grunt_0-4-5
```

## If a package doesn't build

There are any number of reasons why a package might not build. Some of the most common ones are:

* The `nixfromnpm` tool wasn't able to generate the definition of one of the package's dependencies. It will insert in the `brokenPackage` function, which, as might be anticipated, never builds. Looking at the call to `brokenPackage` will tell you why it couldn't build it. In my experience, this is because `nixfromnpm`'s version range checker is not completely up to spec, and it's unable to find a version that satisfies the bounds given by a `package.json`. If this is the case, the easiest way to fix it is to use `npm` to:
  * See what version range `nixfromnpm` failed to resolve. E.g. `foo@>=1.2.3-bar <2.3.4-baz.qux`.
  * Manually build the package at the given version bounds. E g. `npm install foo@>=1.2.3-bar <2.3.4-baz.qux`.
  * See what version it ends up building. E.g. `foo@1.2.3-xyz`.
  * Call `nixfromnpm` on that version. E.g. `nixfromnpm -o /path/to/nix-node-packages -p 'foo%1.2.3-xyz'`.
  * Replace the call to `brokenPackage` with `foo_1-2-3-xyz`.
* The build fails with `npm` complaining about HTTP errors. This is usually caused by a dependency that wasn't satified, likely because `nixfromnpm` calculated the wrong dependency. In this case, use steps similar to the above to find out what the actual dependency should be, and modify the package definition to include the correct one.
* A package build script is attempting to do some hacky bullshit like modifying its dependencies. This, of course, is not kosher in the `nix` view of things. In this case, you'll probably want to `nix-shell` into the package and see what it's trying to do. Figure out how to stop it from doing these things, and supply `prePatch` or `postPatch` steps to apply those changes.

Fixing broken packages is great, because the way nix works, you'll only need to fix them once (although, getting that to propagate to future versions might not be as easy). By all means, please make pull requests for any of these fixes.

## Extending the libraries

It's possible that you'll want to add additional packages that haven't been defined here. Alternatively, you might have your own packages, perhaps private, that you want to generate expressions for, but not have alongside all of the other packages in this repo. While you can always write these packages by hand, it's easier to do this with `nixfromnpm`. It can be obtained [here](https://github.com/adnelson/nixfromnpm). As with fixes above, feel free to pull request any new packages added, whether by hand or auto-generated.

### Adding new packages to the central package set

```bash
$ nixfromnpm -p package1 -p package2 -o nix-node-packages
```

This will calculate expressions for `package1` and `package2`, and place the generated expressions alongside all of the existing packages.

### Create a new package set which refers to the central set

```bash
$ nixfromnpm -p package1 -p package2 -o path/to/new/set --extend nix-node-packages
```

This will calculate expressions for `package1` and `package2`, and place them and their dependencies in `path/to/new/set`. However, any dependencies which exist in `nix-node-packages/nodePackages` will not need to be fetched, and will not appear in `path/to/new/set`.

### Generate a `default.nix` file from a project

You might have a project which has a `package.json` that specifies a bunch of dependencies. You can use `nixfromnpm` to generate expressions for the package's dependencies, and output a `default.nix` file for the package.

```bash
$ nixfromnpm -f path/to/project -o nix-node-packags
```
